## [0.7.0] - 2016-10-28
Tag name: v0.7.0
= commit: 
committed: 

### Added
- Stale transactions in the `backlog` table now get reassigned to another node (for inclusion in a new block): [Pull Request #359](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/359)
- Many improvements to make the database connection more robust: [Pull Request #623](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/623)
- The new `--dev-allow-temp-keypair` option on `bigchaindb start` will generate a temporary keypair if no keypair is found. The `Dockerfile` was updated to use this. [Pull Request #635](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/635)
- The AWS deployment scripts now allow you to:
   - specify the AWS security group as a configuration parameter: [Pull Request #620](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/620)
   - tell RethinkDB to bind HTTP to localhost (a more secure setup; now the default in the example config file): [Pull Request #666](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/666)

### Changed
- Integrated the new `Transaction` model. This was a **big** change; 49 files changed. [Pull Request #641](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/641)
- Merged "common" code (used by BigchainDB Server and the Python driver), which used to be in its own repository (`bigchaindb/bigchaindb-common`), into the main `bigchaindb/bigchaindb` repository (this one): [Pull Request #742](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/742)
- Integrated the new digital asset model. This changed the data structure of a transaction and will make it easier to support divisible assets in the future. [Pull Request #680](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/680)
- Transactions are now deleted from the `backlog` table _after_ a block containing them is written to the `bigchain` table: [Pull Request #609](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/609)
- Changed the example AWS deployment configuration file: [Pull Request #665](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/665)
- Support for version 0.5.0 of the `cryptoconditions` Python package. Note that this means you must now install `ffi.h` (e.g. `sudo apt-get install libffi-dev` on Ubuntu). See Pull Requests [#685](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/685) and [#698](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/698)
- Updated some database access code: Pull Requests [#676](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/676) and [#701](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/701)

### Fixed
- Internally, when a transaction is in the `backlog` table, it carries some extra book-keeping fields:
   1. an `assignment_timestamp` (i.e. the time when it was assigned to a node), which is used to determine if it has gone stale.
   2. an `assignee`: the public key of the node it was assigned to.
- The `assignment_timestamp` wasn't removed before writing the transaction to a block. That was fixed in [Pull Request #627](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/627)
- The `assignment_timestamp` and `assignee` weren't removed in the response to an HTTP API request sent to the `/api/v1/transactions/<txid>` endpoint. That was fixed in [Pull Request #646](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/646)
- When validating a TRANSFER transaction, if any fulfillment refers to a transaction that's _not_ in a valid block, then the transaction isn't valid. This wasn't checked before but it is now. [Pull Request #629](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/629)  

### External Contributors
- @MinchinWeb - [Pull Request #696](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/696)

### Notes
- We made a small change to how we do version labeling. Going forward, we will have the version label set to 0.X.Y.dev in the master branch as we work on what will eventually be released as version 0.X.Y. The version number will only be changed to 0.X.Y just before the release. This version labeling scheme began with [Pull Request #752](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/752)

- Improved and expanded the GET/POST endpoints for transactions (in the HTTP API): [Pull Request #563](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/563)
- Changed the AWS cluster deployment scripts so that the deployer now generates their keypair locally, rather than having Amazon do it: [Pull Request #567](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/567)
- When a transaction is retrieved by `get_transaction`, a `validity` field is added with a value one of `valid`, `undecided`, or `backlog`: [Pull Request #574](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/574)

- Use `flask_restful` and class-based views for realizing the HTTP API: [Pull Request #588](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/588)

### Fixed
- Fixed the confusing error message when there was a syntax error in the BigchainDB config file: [Pull Request #531](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/531)
- Fixed `write_transaction` so it no longer has the side effect of adding `assignee` to a transaction that is being processed: [Pull Request #606](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/606)

- New `bigchaindb` command to set the number of RethinkDB shards (in both tables): [Pull Request #258](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/258)
- Better handling of an outdated `setuptools`: [Pull Request #279](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/279)

### Changed
- The block processes now use GroupProcess: [Pull Request #267](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/267)

- Overhauled `ROADMAP.md` and moved it to [the bigchaindb/org repository](https://github.com/bigchaindb/org): Pull Requests 
[#282](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/282),
[#306](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/306),
[#308](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/308),

### Fixed
- Bug related to transaction malleability: [Pull Request #281](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/281)

### Notes
You can now see a big-picture view of all BigchainDB repositories on [a waffle.io board](https://waffle.io/bigchaindb/org).


## [0.3.0] - 2016-05-03
Tag name: v0.3.0
= commit: a97c54e82be954a1411e5bfe0f09a9c631309f1e
committed: May 3, 2016, 11:52 AM GMT+2

### Added
- Crypto-conditions specs according to the Interledger protocol: [Pull Request #174](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/174)
- Added support for anonymous hashlocked conditions and fulfillments: [Pull Request #211](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/211)

### Changed
- Several improvements to the AWS deployment scripts: [Pull Request #227](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/227)

### Fixed
- Bug related to block validation: [Pull Request #233](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/233)

### Notes
This release completely refactored the structure of the transactions and broke compatibility with older versions
of BigchainDB. The refactor of the transactions was made in order to add support for multiple inputs/outputs and
the crypto-conditions specs from the Interledger protocol.

We also updated the RethinkDB Python drivers so you need to upgrade to RethinkDB v2.3+
