# Production Node Assumptions

If you're not sure what we mean by a BigchainDB *node*, *cluster*, *federation*, or *production node*, then see [the section in the Introduction where we defined those terms](../introduction.html#some-basic-vocabulary).

We make some assumptions about production nodes:

1. **Each production node is set up and managed by an experienced professional system administrator (or a team of them).**

2. Each production node in a federation's cluster is managed by a different person or team.

Because of the first assumption, we don't provide a detailed cookbook explaining how to secure a server, or other things that a sysadmin should know. (We do provide some [starter templates](../cloud-deployment-starter-templates/index.html), but those are just a starting point.)
