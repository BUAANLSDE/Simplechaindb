Data Models
===========

BigchainDB stores all data in the underlying database as JSON documents (conceptually, at least). There are three main kinds:

1. Transactions, which contain digital assets, conditions, fulfillments and other things
2. Blocks
3. Votes

This section unpacks each one in turn.
