# Kinds of Node Diversity

Steps should be taken to make it difficult for any one actor or event to control or damage “enough” of the nodes. (“Enough” is usually a quorum.) There are many kinds of diversity to consider, listed below. It may be quite difficult to have high diversity of all kinds.

1. **Jurisdictional diversity.** The nodes should be controlled by entities within multiple legal jurisdictions, so that it becomes difficult to use legal means to compel enough of them to do something.
2. **Geographic diversity.** The servers should be physically located at multiple geographic locations, so that it becomes difficult for a natural disaster (such as a flood or earthquake) to damage enough of them to cause problems.
3. **Hosting diversity.** The servers should be hosted by multiple hosting providers (e.g. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Digital Ocean, Rackspace), so that it becomes difficult for one hosting provider to influence enough of the nodes.
4. **Operating system diversity.** The servers should use a variety of operating systems, so that a security bug in one OS can’t be used to exploit enough of the nodes.
5. **Diversity in general.** In general, membership diversity (of all kinds) confers many advantages on a federation. For example, it provides the federation with a source of various ideas for addressing challenges.

Note: If all the nodes are running the same code, i.e. the same implementation of BigchainDB, then a bug in that code could be used to compromise all of the nodes. Ideally, there would be several different, well-maintained implementations of BigchainDB Server (e.g. one in Python, one in Go, etc.), so that a federation could also have a diversity of server implementations.
