# Production-Ready?

BigchainDB is not production-ready. You can use it to build a prototype or proof-of-concept (POC); many people are already doing that.

BigchainDB Server is currently in version 0.X. ([The Releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/releases) has the exact version number.) Once we believe that BigchainDB Server is production-ready, we'll release version 1.0.

[The BigchainDB Roadmap](https://github.com/bigchaindb/org/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) will give you a sense of the things we intend to do with BigchainDB in the near term and the long term.
